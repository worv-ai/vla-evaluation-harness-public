**External-only**: results are maintained exclusively on the [official leaderboard](https://robochallenge.ai/leaderboard). This registry entry exists to link out; `leaderboard.json` must contain **zero** rows for this benchmark.

A bi-weekly API mirror ran until 2026-07 and was retired: submissions arrive on the official board's own cadence, and mirrored rows needed manual model-to-paper mapping that decayed without attention.

## Checks
- Any candidate row for this benchmark must be rejected entirely, whatever its source (paper extraction or API). Do not retain rows with `overall_score = null`.
