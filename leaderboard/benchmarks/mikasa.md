**Standard**: 5-task VLA evaluation ([2502.10550](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10550)) on ShellGameTouch, InterceptMedium, RememberColor3, RememberColor5, RememberColor9 at 100 episodes per task; `overall_score` = arithmetic mean of the 5 task success rates.

## Scoring
- `overall_score`: arithmetic mean over the 5 standard tasks; `null` for non-standard task sets.
- `suite_scores`: not used at this level — exception: `suite_scores.reported_avg` stores the paper's own aggregate when the entry uses a non-standard set.
- `task_scores`: canonical keys `ShellGameTouch`, `InterceptMedium`, `RememberColor3`, `RememberColor5`, `RememberColor9`.

## Checks
- Is this the 5-task VLA protocol (ShellGameTouch, InterceptMedium, RememberColor3/5/9)? The ELMUR 4-task variant (RC3/5/9 + TakeItBack) → `overall_score = null`, paper aggregate stored in `suite_scores.reported_avg`.
- Are all 5 tasks present in `task_scores` with their own success rates?
- Is a non-standard aggregate preserved in `suite_scores.reported_avg` rather than `overall_score`?

## Methodology axes (record in `notes`, do not null)
- Evaluation episode count: standard is 100 per task. Record deviations.
