**External-only**: results are maintained exclusively on the [official leaderboard](https://robo-arena.github.io/leaderboard). This registry entry exists to link out; `leaderboard.json` must contain **zero** rows for this benchmark.

Elo ratings change with every pairwise match, so any snapshot copied here is immediately stale. A bi-weekly API mirror ran until 2026-07 and was retired for that reason.

## Checks
- Any candidate row for this benchmark must be rejected entirely, whatever its source (paper extraction or API). Do not retain rows with `overall_score = null`.
