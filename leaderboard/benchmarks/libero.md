**Standard**: LIBERO 4-suite average (`spatial`, `object`, `goal`, `10`) trained on the standard 50-demo budget; `overall_score` = arithmetic mean of the four suites.

## Scoring
- `overall_score`: arithmetic mean of `suite_scores.libero_spatial`, `libero_object`, `libero_goal`, `libero_10`; `null` if any of the four is missing.
- `suite_scores`: canonical keys `libero_spatial`, `libero_object`, `libero_goal`, `libero_10`. A reported 5th suite goes in `libero_90` and is EXCLUDED from `overall_score`.
- `task_scores`: not used at this level — per-task numbers belong on individual LIBERO sub-benchmarks.

## Checks
- Are all four standard suites (`libero_spatial`, `libero_object`, `libero_goal`, `libero_10`) present? If not → `overall_score = null`.
- Is `libero_90` (when reported) stored only in `suite_scores.libero_90` and kept out of the 4-suite mean?
- Is this standard LIBERO and not LIBERO-Plus, LIBERO-Pro, or LIBERO-Mem (those are separate benchmarks)?

## Methodology axes (record in `notes`, do not null)
- Training data budget: standard is 50 demos/task. Reduced-data setups (e.g. 10 demos/task, 1/10 LIBERO, JEPA-VLA's reduced setting) are valid entries with the budget noted — not grounds for nulling.
- Evaluation rollouts per task: note any deviation from the common 50-rollout convention.
