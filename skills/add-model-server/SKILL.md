# Add a model server

Work from the target harness checkout; paths below are relative to it. Read
`AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `configs/README.md`, and a comparable server.
For an existing integration, focus on the changed behavior.

## 1. Integration scope

Identify the checkpoint, upstream evaluator, target embodiment/benchmark, required
inputs, action format, and temporal behavior. Checkpoint variants may differ.

Choose an existing bridge config, a focused bridge extension, or a dedicated server
based on what is missing. Use `PredictModelServer` for blocking inference and
`ModelServer` for custom async behavior; use `run_server()` for the CLI.

## 2. Dependencies and model assets

Resolve weights/revision, architecture config, tokenizer, image processor, adapters,
normalization statistics/dataset keys, and auxiliary models.

- Reuse Hub caches or explicit local paths; document downloads and overrides.
  Verify requested files/revisions, not merely the existence of any snapshot.
- Fail on missing checkpoint/suite assets; do not select another checkpoint or
  invent processor defaults. Expose supported local tokenizer/processor overrides.
- Use a PEP 723 uv script with an editable harness dependency at the correct relative
  path, commit-pinned git dependencies, and `exclude-newer` set to the verification
  date. Verify resolved imports and real inference in that isolated environment.
- Prefer installable upstream packages; use the existing pinned-clone/cache pattern
  when packaging is unavailable. Never clone over a user-provided checkout.

Load the policy once during initialization. Put checkpoint configs under
`configs/model_servers/<name>/`, using `extends: _base.yaml` for shared settings.

## 3. Inference adapter

Trace observation → preprocessing → policy → decoded action → benchmark input.
Assign each transform to one layer: camera order/resize/crop/aspect ratio, pixel and
state normalization, action denormalization, frame/rotation/units, and gripper mapping.
Inspect upstream processors before adding transforms they already perform.

| Interface | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `get_observation_params()` | Request benchmark-supported inputs such as wrist/state; verify actual delivery and config overrides. |
| `get_observation_spec()` / `get_action_spec()` | Declare input/output semantics; shape checks alone cannot establish compatibility. |
| `predict(obs, ctx)` | Return `{"actions": array}` shaped `(action_dim,)` or `(chunk_size, action_dim)`. |
| `predict_batch(obs_batch, ctx_batch)` | Required for `max_batch_size > 1`; return one result per request in matching order. |

Read current contracts in `src/vla_eval/model_servers/base.py` and `predict.py`;
`cogact.py` provides a concrete server/batching example. Do not fabricate or pad
missing inputs unless that behavior belongs to the upstream policy.

## 4. State and concurrency

- Identify ownership of history, recurrent state, action queues, and ensembling.
  Preserve replanning frequency; cached chunks may bypass observations needed by
  policies that update on every executed step.
- Isolate mutable state per session. Sessions span episodes: reset policy-owned
  state in `on_episode_start`, then await the superclass hook. Base buffers and
  policy history are separate; reset only the starting session and clean up stale state.
- Verify batching with mixed sessions, episode lengths, and resets. Compare single
  and batched behavior with controlled inputs/randomness, allowing justified
  stochastic or numerical differences rather than requiring bitwise identity.

## 5. Validation and handoff

Run `make check`, `make test`, and config validation. Check smoke discovery with
`uv run vla-eval test --list`. With weights and allocated compute:

```bash
uv run vla-eval test -c configs/model_servers/<name>/<config>.yaml
```

Compare upstream and adapter on the same observation/history: inspect intermediate
tensors and decoded actions to locate the first divergence. Follow with a real
rollout, consecutive episodes, and concurrent sessions where supported. If upstream
also fails, report that limitation instead of tuning toward a published score.

Test transformations and lifecycle mechanics directly; fake model-library modules
cannot replace real loading/inference checks. Distinguish loading, inference,
rollout, and reproduction support in the documentation.

After correctness checks, measure warm latency, throughput, and memory on representative
inputs, separately from download/load/compile costs. Record and validate changes to
precision, inference steps, or action horizon: they may change the policy.
Deliver acquisition instructions, configs, supported inputs/benchmarks, state/batching
behavior, and completed or unavailable checks.
