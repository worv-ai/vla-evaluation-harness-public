## Summary

Add episode-level sharding so that N independent OS processes can evaluate disjoint subsets of episodes in parallel, sharing a single model server. A `merge` command combines shard results into a unified report. This is the primary mechanism for reducing wall-clock evaluation time.

## Motivation

LIBERO Spatial: 10 tasks × 50 episodes × ~220 steps = ~110,000 steps, executed sequentially. A single evaluation run takes hours. The bottleneck is the serial alternation of CPU simulation and GPU inference: while one is working, the other is idle.

Parallelizing at the episode level is the most impactful optimization because:
1. Episodes are independent, with no shared state between them.
2. Multiple simulation processes can overlap their inference wait time with other simulations.
3. The model server already accepts multiple WebSocket clients concurrently.

### Why shell-level processes, not in-process multiprocessing?

Some benchmark simulators (notably LIBERO/robosuite) have internal state that conflicts with Python `multiprocessing` (OpenGL contexts, MuJoCo shared memory, global state in `robosuite.utils`). Shell-level process isolation (`cmd &`) avoids these issues entirely because each process gets its own address space with no shared state.

## Design

### CLI Interface

```bash
# Run 4 shards in parallel
vla-eval run -c libero_spatial.yaml --shard-id 0 --num-shards 4 &
vla-eval run -c libero_spatial.yaml --shard-id 1 --num-shards 4 &
vla-eval run -c libero_spatial.yaml --shard-id 2 --num-shards 4 &
vla-eval run -c libero_spatial.yaml --shard-id 3 --num-shards 4 &
wait

# Merge results
vla-eval merge results/libero_spatial_shard*.json -o results/libero_spatial.json
```

Without `--shard-id`/`--num-shards`, behavior is unchanged (single process, all episodes).

### Shard Assignment

Work items are the flat list of `(task, episode_idx)` pairs. Round-robin assignment distributes them evenly:

```python
work_items = [(task, ep) for task in tasks for ep in range(episodes_per_task)]
my_items = [w for i, w in enumerate(work_items) if i % num_shards == shard_id]
```

Round-robin (not contiguous blocks) because different tasks may have different max_steps, and round-robin naturally balances load across shards.

### Result File Naming

Shard results use deterministic filenames (no timestamp) so re-runs overwrite previous attempts:

```
results/{benchmark_name}_shard{id}of{total}.json
```

Non-sharded runs keep the existing `{name}_{mode}_{timestamp}.json` format.

### Shard Metadata in Result JSON

Each shard result includes shard provenance:

```json
{
  "benchmark": "libero_spatial",
  "mode": "sync",
  "shard": {"id": 0, "total": 4},
  "partial": false,
  "tasks": [ ... ],
  "overall_success_rate": 0.92
}
```

The `"shard"` field is absent in non-sharded runs.

### Merge Command

`vla-eval merge <glob> [-o output.json]` performs:

1. **Load** all shard JSON files.
2. **Validate** consistency: same benchmark name, same shard total, no duplicate shard IDs.
3. **Detect missing shards**: compare found shard IDs against `range(total)`.
4. **Merge episodes** by task name. Deduplicate by `episode_id` (last-write-wins for re-runs).
5. **Aggregate** metrics: per-task success rate, overall success rate.
6. **Report** coverage and save merged result.

Output example:
```
All 4 shards complete. Coverage: 500/500 episodes (100.0%)
Overall success rate: 94.2% (471/500)
Saved to: results/libero_spatial.json
```

Partial example:
```
⚠ Missing shards: [2] (expected 0..3)
Coverage: 375/500 episodes (75.0%)
Merged result (PARTIAL): 93.1% (349/375)
Saved to: results/libero_spatial.json

To complete: vla-eval run -c libero_spatial.yaml --shard-id 2 --num-shards 4
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Shard process crashes | No result file (or partial). `merge` detects missing shard, reports coverage gap, suggests re-run command. |
| Some episodes fail within a shard | Existing per-episode error isolation (RFC-0004). Episodes recorded with `failure_reason`. Shard file marked `partial: true`. |
| Re-run a failed shard | Deterministic filename overwrites previous attempt. `merge` deduplicates by `episode_id` (last-write-wins). |
| All shards succeed | Clean merge, full coverage. |

## Interaction with Docker

Sharding args pass through to the Docker container transparently:

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/allenai/vla-evaluation-harness/libero:latest run --no-docker --config /tmp/config.yaml --shard-id 0 --num-shards 4
```

The `run_via_docker` function (`cli/_docker.py`) forwards `--shard-id` and `--num-shards` to the container command.

## Interaction with Model Server

N shard processes connect to the same model server URL. The server already handles multiple WebSocket clients via `websockets.serve` (one coroutine per connection). `PredictModelServer` dispatches each request to `run_in_executor`, so N concurrent requests run in N threads.

This is **not** true GPU batching; requests are serialized on the GPU. True batching requires `BatchPredictModelServer` (RFC-0003, future work). However, even without batching, sharding provides significant speedup because simulation time in one process overlaps with inference time in another.

## Implementation Scope

| Change | File | ~Lines |
|--------|------|--------|
| CLI args `--shard-id`, `--num-shards` | `cli/main.py` | ~15 |
| Shard filtering + deterministic filenames | `orchestrator.py` | ~30 |
| `vla-eval merge` command | `cli/main.py` + `results/merge.py` | ~100 |
| Docker arg forwarding | `cli/main.py` | ~5 |
| Tests | `tests/` | ~80 |

Total: ~230 lines of new/changed code.

## Future Work

- **`vla-eval run-parallel`**: Convenience wrapper that spawns N shard processes + auto-merges. Not needed for v1; shell scripts suffice.
