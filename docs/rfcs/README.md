# RFCs

Design documents for `vla-evaluation-harness`, a framework for evaluating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models across robot simulation benchmarks.

RFCs capture significant architectural decisions and proposed changes. They exist so contributors can understand *why* the system works the way it does, and to provide a lightweight review process for non-trivial changes.
