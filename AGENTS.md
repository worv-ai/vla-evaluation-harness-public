## Project Overview

**vla-evaluation-harness** (`vla-eval`) is a unified evaluation framework for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models across 11+ robot simulation benchmarks. Models integrate once, benchmarks integrate once, and the full cross-evaluation matrix works automatically.

Core design: Model server communicates with benchmark (Docker container, with optional GPU access for rendering) via WebSocket + msgpack binary protocol. This decouples model dependencies from benchmark dependencies entirely.

## Commands

```bash
# Setup
uv sync --python 3.11 --all-extras --dev

# Quality (CI runs these on every PR)
make lint          # ruff check --fix + ruff format
make check         # ruff check + ruff format --check + ty check (no auto-fix)
make test          # uv run pytest

# Single test
uv run pytest tests/test_protocol.py -v
uv run pytest tests/test_protocol.py::test_name -v

# Smoke tests (model servers, benchmarks, config validation)
vla-eval test                                       # validate configs only (fast, default)
vla-eval test --all                                 # run all categories (validate + server + benchmark)
vla-eval test --list                                # show available tests + prerequisites
vla-eval test --server                              # smoke-test all model servers
vla-eval test --benchmark                           # smoke-test all benchmarks
vla-eval test -c configs/model_servers/cogact.yaml  # smoke-test a specific config
make smoke                                          # shortcut for vla-eval test --all
```

Line length is **119** (configured in pyproject.toml for ruff and ty).

## Architecture

```
CLI (cli/main.py)
 └─ Orchestrator (orchestrator.py)
     ├─ Benchmark (benchmarks/base.py)  ── runs inside Docker container
     │   └─ EpisodeRunner (runners/)    ── sync or live
     │       └─ Connection (connection.py) ←─ WebSocket/msgpack ─→ ModelServer (model_servers/base.py)
     ├─ ResultCollector (results/collector.py)  ── in-memory aggregation for stdout summary
     └─ RecordingStore (recording.py) ── SQLite (one per eval) capturing step rows + per-episode results
```

### Key design decisions

- **Episode-level error isolation**: One episode failure never aborts the entire evaluation.
- **anyio-based async**: asyncio-compatible, not trio. Use anyio primitives for new async code.
- **Parallel evaluation**: Environment parallelism via episode sharding + inference parallelism via batch forward passes.
- **Recording goes through SQLite**: one `recording-<eval_id>.sqlite` stores run identity/reporting settings, benchmark metadata, episodes, and steps. DELETE journaling + EXTRA sync and explicit transactions serialize shard/model-server writes; `json_patch` unions fields for the same `(sid, eid, step_id)`. Shared storage must support SQLite file locks and sync.

### Recording flow

Benchmark entries write raw rows to `<output_dir>/recording-<eval_id>.sqlite` by default:

- Recording defaults to `record_step: true` and `record_video: false`. The optional **benchmark config's top-level `recording:` key** (sibling of `params`) overrides that policy. The orchestrator reads this dict (`output_dir`, `filename_stem`, `record_video`, `record_step`, `video_fps`) and builds the recorder. Benchmarks are not involved in recording policy; they only decide *what* to record (which obs frame, which step fields).
- Benchmark calls `recorder.record_video(frame)` / `recorder.record_step(row)`; the recorder buffers per-episode and flushes in one transaction at episode end.
- `filename_stem` (default `"{benchmark_safe_name}/task{task_idx:04d}_ep{episode_id:04d}_{status}"`) is a `str.format` template against the task dict's serializable fields + `{status}` plus orchestrator-injected keys (`benchmark_safe_name`, `task_idx`, `episode_id`). `task_idx` is assigned before shard filtering, and `episode_id` is the raw run episode id. The orchestrator validates it against the first task at startup so a typo fails fast.
- Model server (optional, used by external callers like a training pipeline) receives `(sid, eid, eval_id, db_path)` in the `EPISODE_START` WS payload and opens a `vla_eval.recording.StepRecorder` to push its own step rows. Field-union with the benchmark's rows is automatic via SQLite `json_patch`.
- `vla-eval export DB [-o DIR]` exports a consistent snapshot to episode JSONL and aggregate JSON (default: DB parent). Saved run metadata supplies tracker identity/config. Single-shard runs export automatically; `scripts/run_sharded.sh` exports after `wait`.
- Use `vla-eval run --record-video` to enable mp4s for all benchmarks without editing YAML.
- `vla-eval run --no-save` skips recording entirely (in-memory only).

### Tracking

Optional sibling to recording: top-level `tracking.report_to: wandb` (or list / `"all"`) in the eval YAML mirrors aggregate metrics to wandb/trackio. Backend settings come from native env vars (`WANDB_*`, `TRACKIO_*`); the harness only injects `eval_id` + `resume="allow"` so live and export paths converge on the same run. Per-episode tracking fires on the live path only; sharded mode defers aggregate emission to `vla-eval export`. See the README "Observability" section.
